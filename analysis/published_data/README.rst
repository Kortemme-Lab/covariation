====================================

This directory contains the raw data used to create the plots in Figure 2 of the publication by Ollikainen and Kortemme.
The entropy_table directory contains the scripts and predicted entropies used to generate sequence_entropy_backrub.txt.

sequence_entropy_backrub_published.txt is the file used to generate the plot for Figure 2 in the publication. sequence_entropy_backrub.txt is an updated version containing more positions. The only positions omitted were those with gaps or non-canonical amino acids at that position in any sequence.
