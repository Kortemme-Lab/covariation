Input data
====================================

The input data for this benchmark consists of 40 structures from the PDB, each of which represents a Pfam domain. The
mapping between the structures and Pfam domains can be found in JSON or CSV format in json/domains.json and csv/domains.csv
respectively.

The selection of the Pfam domains and their structures is described in the following paper:

This directory also includes two res files, one for repacking all positions (NATAA.res) and one for designing all positions (ALLAA.res).
