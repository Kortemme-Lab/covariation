Flexible backbone design using backrub ensembles 

Flexible backbone design that uses backrub moves to generate a conformational ensemble. 
This protocol outputs two sets of structures; “low” structures have the lowest energy 
conformation for each simulation and “last” structures have the last conformation that 
was sampled in the simulation. Fixbb is used on each “last” structure to identify a low 
energy sequence.  The value of KT was varied to generate structures with varying degrees 
of structural variation. The following command line options were used:

./backrub.linuxgccrelease –database rosetta_database –s input.pdb –resfile NATAA.res 
–ex1 –ex2 –extrachi_cutoff 0 –backrub:mc_kt KT –backrub:ntrials 10000 –nstruct 500 
–backrub:initial_pack

Fixbb command line:

./fixbb.linuxgccrelease –database rosetta_database –s input.pdb –resfile ALLAA.res –ex1 
–ex2 –extrachi_cutoff 0 –nstruct 500 –linmem_ig 10 –no_his_his_pairE –minimize_sidechains
